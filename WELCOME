Welcome to the Docker image for AMS 526 Docker Image! This image is based on
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, with GCC-11, VScode, LAPACK, ddd, and Eigen preinstalled.

The home directory of the Docker image maps to a Docker data volume named
ams526_home, which is persistent even after you stop the docker container.
The ~/shared directory maps to the current work directory on your computer,
which may be slow but can be convenient for copying files between the host
computer and the Docker container.

Happy computing!
