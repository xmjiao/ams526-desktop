Welcome to the Docker image for AMS 526 Docker Image!

This image is based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, with GCC-11, VScode, LAPACK, ddd,
valgrind, and Eigen preinstalled.

Please save your code and data into the ~/shared or ~/project directories.
The former maps to the current work directory on your computer. The latter
maps to a Docker data volume named ams526_project on your host.

To use git with ssh authentication, make sure the ssh key on your host computer
is in bitbucket and github, and then run "ssh-add" in this terminal to add your
ssh key to the ssh-agent.

Happy coding!
